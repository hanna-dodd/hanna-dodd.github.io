Hey, I'm Hanna and I like to do hard things.

I'm a master's student at the University of Waterloo, where I research tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) and computational creativity. My current research interests lie in video games, interactive narratives, and human-computer interaction. 

My family has affectionately dubbed me a "master of libraries and dungeons." I earned my MLIS from Western University, where I studied the information behaviour of TTRPG players navigating fictional worlds. Beyond research, I have a deep love for storytelling. I've been a game master for five years, running Dungeons & Dragons games for both longtime friends and brand-new players.

I'm a lover of logic puzzles, climbing plastic rocks, and walking long distances in the forest alone. I find joy in solving problems and telling stories, whether through writing, research, or gameplay. At my core, I'm curious about how stories can change people, and how technology can help facilitate those stories. 

There's always another adventure worth going on.
